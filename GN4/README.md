## Prerequisites and GeoNode Training Virtual Machine

* If you have successfully completed one of the previous _training modules_, you can keep using the same _Virtual Machine_ deployed at [GN1](../GN1/QUICK_INSTALL.md)
* If you are starting this module from scratch, you might want to install a _Virtual Machine_ with dataset already configured and deployed.
   - Download the _Virtual Machine OVA_ archive named [GeoNode 3.2.1 - GN2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7sqdz0fe1i3hdem/GeoNode%203.2.1%20-%20GN2.ova?dl=1)
   
     **WARNING**: _The file is quite big, about_ `8.7 GB`. _Please make sure you downloaded it before the training actually starts._
   -  Deploy and start the _Virtual Machine_ as described on GN1 section [Quick Installation Guide](../GN1/QUICK_INSTALL.md)
   -  Check the users and services deployed on the _Virtual Machine_ from the GN1 section [GeoNode Virtual Machine Structure](../GN1/VM_STRUCTURE.md)
* Make sure you are familiar with GeoNode and its functionalities and your _Virtual Machine_ is correctly working and configured as per _GN1 Training module_.

     **WARNING**: _In the next sections we might refer to some GeoNode users and datasets deployed and configured during the previous modules._

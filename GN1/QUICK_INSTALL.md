# Quick installation guide
The purpose of this section is to provide you with basic informations on the structure and contents of the training Virtual Machine.

In order to simplify the installation procedure, a self-contained package comprising the various executables as well as the data used throughout the training are provided to download or can be viewed online at this link:

 - [GeoNode 3.3.x.ova](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6pfgk37trbnnj57/GeoNode%203.3.x.ova?dl=1)

The package is an Oracle VirtualBox `OVA` image which must be loaded into a running Virtual Box instance.

**WARNING**: The package is about `8.56 GB` big, therefore consider downloading it and setting up VirtualBox, as explained below, **before** the training sessions start.
